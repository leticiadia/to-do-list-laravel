## 💻 Description

<p>ToDoList is a simple application to create day-to-day tasks</p>

## 📖 About ToDoList

<p>
    ToDoList was created with the purpose of studies to learn more about Laravel. Despite being a simple application, I was able to learn more about blade, which is a simple and powerful Laravel engineering monitor. I also learned more about routes, paging, and search.
</p>

<p>
  Vite was also used in this application. For those unfamiliar with Vite, it is a frontend build tool, which provides a fast development environment and bundles your code for production. In the case of Laravel, using Vite to bundle the application's CSS and JavaScript files into production ready assets.
